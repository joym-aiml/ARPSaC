# 📅 Dev Log — {today}

**Project:** ARPSaC — Agentic AI for Automated Research Paper Summarization and Critique  
**Focus Area:** ADK-compatible summarization agent and arXiv search integration

---

## ✅ Summary

Today’s work focused on architecting and building the first fully ADK-compatible agents for paper retrieval and summarization. This included understanding the ADK BaseAgent lifecycle, building summarization logic using `flan-t5-small`, and integrating arXiv API to dynamically fetch scientific papers based on user query input.

---

## 📂 Tasks Completed

### 🧠 ADK Agent Architecture
- [x] Deep-dived into the official [Google ADK documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/)
- [x] Understood `BaseAgent`, `InvocationContext`, and `Event` structures
- [x] Reviewed how `SequentialAgent` orchestrates workflows
- [x] Explained `SummarizeAgent` line-by-line for clarity and documentation

### 📄 SummarizeAgent Implementation
- [x] Wrapped `flan-t5-small` model into an ADK-compatible agent
- [x] Leveraged `_run_async_impl` to interact with session state
- [x] Used `yield Event(...)` to return summarization outputs cleanly
- [x] Stored final summaries in `session.state["summary"]`

### 🔍 FetchPaperAgent Design & Build
- [x] Built `FetchPaperAgent` using the arXiv API
- [x] Implemented XML parsing to extract paper ID, title, and summary
- [x] Stored search results in `session.state["search_results"]`
- [x] Yielded user-readable output listing top N results

### 💡 Strategy & Orchestration Planning
- [x] Defined user-query ➝ search ➝ select ➝ summarize agent flow
- [x] Drafted plan for `SelectionAgent` and `FetchDetailAgent` as next steps
- [x] Designed memory-sharing layout using `session.state`

## 🔍 Key Takeaways

- ✅ ADK agents are class-based, async generators, and state-aware
- ✅ Agent interaction via session memory supports modularity and reuse
- ✅ arXiv integration works well with XML + search filtering
- ✅ Model and logic abstraction allow for plug-and-play orchestration

---

## 🧭 Next Steps

- [ ] Build `SelectionAgent` to allow user to choose a paper
- [ ] Create `FetchDetailAgent` to pull full paper content via arXiv ID
- [ ] Plug in `SummarizeAgent` as a downstream step
- [ ] Begin constructing full pipeline with ADK `SequentialAgent`

## 📌 Reflection

Today marked a significant step from standalone experimentation to structured multi-agent orchestration using Google ADK. With the Fetch and Summarize agents both ADK-compliant, the foundation for scalable paper intelligence pipelines is now set.
