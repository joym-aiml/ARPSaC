📅 Daily Progress Tracker — {today_str}

**Project:** ARPSaC — Agentic AI for Automated Research Paper Summarization and Critique  
**Focus Area:** Model experimentation and evaluation framework

---

## ✅ Key Accomplishments

- Completed environment reconfiguration by removing Python 3.13 and switching to 3.12
- Re-created virtual environment and verified package compatibility
- Ran and validated `flan-t5-small` summarizer with scientific input
- Successfully loaded and tested `facebook/bart-large-cnn` summarizer
- Resolved loading warnings and executed `google/pegasus-xsum` summarizer
- Compared model outputs qualitatively across fluency, informativeness, and tone

---

## 📈 Evaluation Infrastructure

- Installed and configured `evaluate` and `bert-score` libraries
- Created `evaluation.ipynb` for computing ROUGE and BERTScore
- Documented output and length comparisons for three baseline models

---

## 🧹 GitHub Clean-Up

- Encountered file size limit error while pushing due to venv contents
- Added `venv/` and `arpsac/` to `.gitignore`
- Removed large files from Git tracking using `git rm --cached`
- Committed and pushed clean repository state

---

## 📌 Reflection

Today marked a shift from infrastructure setup to hands-on experimentation. The model evaluation framework is now in place, enabling future iterations to focus on pipeline integration and performance tuning.

# 📅 Daily Progress Tracker — {today}

**Project:** ARPSaC — Agentic AI for Automated Research Paper Summarization and Critique  
**Focus Area:** Summarization and Paper Retrieval Agent Implementation (ADK-Compatible)

---

## ✅ Key Accomplishments

- 🎯 Finalized understanding of ADK agent model (BaseAgent, InvocationContext, Event)
- 🧠 Deep walkthrough of the full SummarizeAgent using `flan-t5-small`
- 🔧 Built ADK-compatible FetchPaperAgent with arXiv API integration
- 📦 Stored structured search results in `session.state["search_results"]`
- 💬 Generated clean output messages summarizing fetched paper titles
- 🔗 Designed session memory fields to enable multi-agent communication

---

## 🧩 Architecture Progress

- [x] `SummarizeAgent` implemented and yielding ADK events
- [x] `FetchPaperAgent` fetching real papers from arXiv based on user queries
- [x] Session state structure defined for paper lists, selection, and summary chaining
- [x] Planned `SelectionAgent` and `FetchDetailAgent` to follow next

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- ADK agents are stateful, asynchronous, and event-yielding by design
- arXiv API requires XML parsing and proper namespacing for metadata
- Modularizing agents using `session.state` leads to clean orchestration
- It's critical to separate interactive steps (fetch vs select vs process)

---

## 🚧 Blockers / Pending

- [ ] User selection interface (or simulated selection for testing)
- [ ] Detail fetch agent using arXiv paper ID
- [ ] Full pipeline runner for: query ➝ list ➝ select ➝ summarize

---

## 🧭 Next Step

Start implementation of `SelectionAgent`, which will enable the user to choose one paper from the search results to be processed further by downstream agents.
