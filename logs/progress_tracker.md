**Project:** ARPSaC â€” Agentic AI for Automated Research Paper Summarization and Critique  
**Focus Area:** Model experimentation and evaluation framework

---

## âœ… Key Accomplishments

- Completed environment reconfiguration by removing Python 3.13 and switching to 3.12
- Re-created virtual environment and verified package compatibility
- Ran and validated `flan-t5-small` summarizer with scientific input
- Successfully loaded and tested `facebook/bart-large-cnn` summarizer
- Resolved loading warnings and executed `google/pegasus-xsum` summarizer
- Compared model outputs qualitatively across fluency, informativeness, and tone

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Infrastructure

- Installed and configured `evaluate` and `bert-score` libraries
- Created `evaluation.ipynb` for computing ROUGE and BERTScore
- Documented output and length comparisons for three baseline models

---

## ðŸ§¹ GitHub Clean-Up

- Encountered file size limit error while pushing due to venv contents
- Added `venv/` and `arpsac/` to `.gitignore`
- Removed large files from Git tracking using `git rm --cached`
- Committed and pushed clean repository state

## ðŸ“Œ Reflection

Today marked a shift from infrastructure setup to hands-on experimentation. The model evaluation framework is now in place, enabling future iterations to focus on pipeline integration and performance tuning.
