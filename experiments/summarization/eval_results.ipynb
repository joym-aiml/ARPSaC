When disorder is introduced into such systems, they can shift into phases that are non-ergodic or localized, potentially simplifying their behavior by reducing the number of states that matter. However, it's still unclear whether these phase transitions also signal a fundamental change in the system's computational complexity.\n",

    "This study explores that question using three key models‚Äîthe power-law random banded matrix model, the Rosenzweig‚ÄìPorter model, and a hybrid SYK+Ising model. It compares three different ways of measuring complexity: fractal dimension, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and stabilizer R√©nyi entropy. While all three indicators show clear transitions between complex and simpler phases as system size increases, they don‚Äôt all agree on exactly where these transitions happen. In particular, during an intermediate ‚Äúfractal phase,‚Äù their behavior diverges.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key finding is that stabilizer R√©nyi entropy appears especially sensitive to deep symmetries in the system, like fermion parity and time-reversal invariance‚Äîmore so than the other metrics. Overall, the results highlight that no single measure fully captures the complexity of quantum phase transitions. Instead, combining multiple metrics provides a more complete understanding‚Äîand the differences between them carry important implications for how well such systems can be simulated on classical computers.\"\"\"\n"
